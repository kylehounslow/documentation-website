# PPL Commands

`PPL` supports most [`SQL` common]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/functions/) functions, including [relevance search]({{site.url}}{{site.baseurl}}/search-plugins/sql/full-text/), but also introduces few more functions (called `commands`) which are available in `PPL` only.

Browse the individual command pages in the navigation menu to learn more about each command.
